# ImgCaption
This project is an Image Caption Generator using deep learning. The goal of the project is to generate a meaningful textual description (caption) for a given image by leveraging a combination of a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).

The dataset is downloaded directly from the below links. The downloading process takes some time due to the datasetâ€™s large size(1GB). In the image below, you can check all the files in the Flickr_8k_text folder. The most important file is Flickr 8k.token, which stores all the image names with captions. 8091 images are stored inside the Flicker8k_Dataset folder and the text files with captions of images are stored in the Flickr_8k_text folder.
